I created my first website using a domain from NameCheap using Jekyll hosted on github pages. Shout out to my friend [Porter Darby][porter-codes] for showing me how his portfolio is built and hosted.

I can't say for sure that I will regularly update this blog with posts. I have a few topics in mind that I want to write about.

Everyone has to start somewhere!

I rented my domain, [justin.computer](https://justin.computer/), from [namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/). I used [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) for hosting. For the page itself, I used [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to generate html from simple text files.

I have a few plans for improvements going forward, such as replacing the default jekyll theme with something of my own design.

A huge thanks to my friend Porter Darby for getting my started by showing me these tools.
